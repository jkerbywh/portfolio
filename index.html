                        Hello! I am Jonathan Kerby-White, an aspiring data scientist and master's student in Statistics and Data Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I earned a bachelor of science in Pure Mathematics from Indiana University Bloomington in 2024. I am most interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

                        <p style="line-height: 2; font-size: 18px;">Eigenmaps are important in analysis, geometry and machine learning, especially in nonlinear dimension reduction.Versions of the Laplacian eigenmaps of Belkin and Niyogi are a widely used nonlinear dimension reduction technique in data analysis.  Data points in a high dimensional space ‚Ñù<sup>N</sup> are treated as vertices of a graph, for example by taking edges between points separated by distance at most a threshold ùúñ or by joining each vertex to its ùëò nearest neighbors.  A small number ùê∑ of eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian are then taken as coordinates for the data, defining an eigenmap to ‚Ñù<sup>N</sup>. This method was motivated by an intuitive argument suggesting that if the original data consisted of ùëõ sufficiently well-distributed points on a nice manifold ùëÄ then the eigenmap would preserve geometric features of ùëÄ.</p>

                        Applications like FaceTune and FaceApp allow their users to edit photograph of themselves or others, usually to touch up a feature to make the photo more appealing. I wrote a code in R that allows the user to take a .png file and smooth the image to the degree of their choosing. I plan to extend this project to allow the user to smooth the image in a specified area of the image. In addition, the code allows the user to detect edges in the photo and outline it (if they choose to) with a color of their choosing. This will be uploaded to GitHub shortly.

                        Have you ever wanted to play a game like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four, but you didn't have anyone to play with? This was the motivation for me to create a Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four game using RStudio. The code allows you to play against an AI opponent. The AI opponent for the Tic-Tac-Toe game is unbeatable. This project was adapted from a project that I completed in STAT 304 at UW-Madison. This will be uploaded to GitHub shortly.
